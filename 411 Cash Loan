This is a form of gift aid that does not have to be repaid. Awards can come from the college itself (called institutional aid), or from outside organizations. Scholarships are typically awarded to students for merit, meaning they meet a certain academic qualification. There are also scholarships for athletics and special talents, as well as those tied to affiliations with organizations or employers, ones aimed at students from specific ethnic groups, etc.

This is another form of gift aid similar to scholarships. The key difference is that grants are usually based on having financial need in addition to other requirements. Some colleges offer institutional grants so be sure to inquire about how to apply. You may also be able to get grants through your state education department. The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators provides a handy list of state financial aid programs.
