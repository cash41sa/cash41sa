In the case of a last-minute circumstance that can prevent you from affording college, you can work with your schoolâ€™s financial aid office to see if the school can offer emergency funds as a loan to you. Availability and school policies vary so be sure you understand repayment obligations before you accept.

Beyond these options, you could explore borrowing from family members directly, or opt for a full-time job while you take affordable classes part-time at a community college.
