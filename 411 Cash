Qualifying for a private student loan can be more challenging when you’re a student because lenders expect you to meet income requirements and have a minimum credit score. These requirements can be difficult to meet since most students do not earn enough income or have a solid credit history established. 

In the rare case that a student does earn enough and meets the credit score requirement, it could be possible to qualify on their own. In most cases, though, to get a private student loan without a parent you’ll have to find someone else who is willing to co-sign for you. It could be a grandparent, an aunt or uncle, or good friend—but convincing them can be hard since they will be on the hook if you don’t make your payments.
